### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `risk_assessment.go` and `risk_assessment_test.go` in the same directory).
- Use `go test ./...` to run all tests in the service directory.
- Integration tests should be in the `test/integration/` directory at the project root.
- The service follows the existing microservices architecture pattern used by other services in the platform.
