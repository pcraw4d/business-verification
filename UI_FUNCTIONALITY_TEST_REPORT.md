## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Form Submission Method** ✅ **FIXED**

       - `web/index.html`
       - `web/add-merchant.html`
       - `services/frontend/public/index.html`
       - `services/frontend/public/add-merchant.html`
     - Added `action="#"` to prevent fallback navigation
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed in codebase, awaiting deployment verification
   - **Verification Required:** After deployment, verify forms submit via POST (check network tab)

2. **Security Indicators Container Warning** ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Original Issue:** Console warning "Security indicators container with ID 'security-indicators' not found"

       - `services/frontend/public/components/security-indicators.js`
     - Changed warning to debug-level message (only shows in debug mode)
     - Added container existence check before initialization
     - Initialize SecurityIndicators only after container is created (in `displayResults()`)
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed in codebase, awaiting deployment verification
   - **Verification Required:** After deployment, verify no console warnings appear

3. **Country Dropdown Selection** ✅ **VERIFIED**
   - **Original Issue:** Dropdown selection may require manual intervention
