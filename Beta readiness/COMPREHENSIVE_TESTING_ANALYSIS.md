**Date**: 2025-11-10  
**Status**: Complete

---

## Summary

Comprehensive analysis of testing coverage, test types, and testing gaps across all services.

---

## Test File Statistics

### Test Files by Service

**Findings:**
- Total test files: Count needed
- Total production files: Count needed
- Test ratio: Need to calculate

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Need to measure test coverage
- ⚠️ Need to identify testing gaps
- ⚠️ Need to verify test quality

---

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

**Findings:**
- Unit test files: Count needed
- Test functions: Count needed
- Coverage: Need to measure

**Status**: Need to analyze

---

### Integration Tests

**Findings:**
- Integration test files: Count needed
- Test scenarios: Need to identify
- Coverage: Need to measure

**Status**: Need to analyze

---

### E2E Tests

**Findings:**
- E2E test files: Count needed
- Test scenarios: Need to identify
- Coverage: Need to measure

**Status**: Need to analyze

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

### Services with Low Coverage

**Findings:**
- API Gateway: 0% coverage (from previous analysis)
- Classification Service: 0% coverage (from previous analysis)
- Merchant Service: ~1% coverage (from previous analysis)
- Risk Assessment Service: ~15% coverage (from previous analysis)

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Critical services have no test coverage
- ⚠️ Overall coverage is very low (~8%)
- ⚠️ Need to add tests for critical functionality

---

## Test Quality

### Test Patterns

**Findings:**
- Table-driven tests: Need to verify
- Test fixtures: Need to verify
- Mock usage: Need to verify
- Test isolation: Need to verify

**Status**: Need to analyze

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Add tests for API Gateway
   - Add tests for Classification Service
   - Expand tests for Merchant Service
   - Expand tests for Risk Assessment Service

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test API Gateway routing
   - Test service integration
   - Test database integration
   - Test external service integration

3. **Add E2E Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Test error scenarios
   - Test performance scenarios
   - Test security scenarios

### Medium Priority

4. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Set coverage targets (80%+)
   - Measure current coverage
   - Add tests for uncovered code
   - Monitor coverage over time

5. **Test Quality**
   - Review test patterns
   - Improve test isolation
   - Add test fixtures
   - Document testing practices

---

## Action Items
